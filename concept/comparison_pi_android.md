# Between a Raspberry PI and a Smartphone based solution. 


## Raspberry PI
- Raspbian based software which is very versatile 
- Hardware development more effort as display sourcing required. Hard to find a suitable display.
- More fundamental development effort if display has no HDMI interface
- Nicer integration into the pannel
- Easier to add feature such as ADS-B traffic reception via DVB-T Stick
- Easier to connect a USB Stickcontrol. 
- More interfaces e.g. one wire for Temperaure or Humidity Sensors
- LTE integration harder as additional hardware required.
- Risk of possible display related EMC issues





## Smartphone 
- Android based software
- Sunlight readable smartphones easily available
- Provides features which are not used: backside camera
- Update to new hardware quick and simple
- LTE available by default
- Battery drains unused during winter. But Backup Battery and GPS in case external supply fails
- Read-Only configuration might be harder to achieve
- Removing bloatware which asks for updates might require a custom ROM (e.g. LineageOS)
